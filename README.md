### Mike's Braindumper

Created out of boredom + wanting to working on something other than [Shelly's website](https://github.com/mploythai/liushelly.com) lmao

This project uses Next.js, Tailwind, and Supabase. Not my best coding or my best designing, but this isn't for prod so it's whatever. Please don't look at the modal component though.

I do wanna build upon this and make it a real SaaS, but for the time being, this is just a little experiment I'll poke at every once in a while :)
